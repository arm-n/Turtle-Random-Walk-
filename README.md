# Turtle-Random-Walk-
The random walk in Turtle graphics models Brownian motion, molecular diffusion, and animal movement in science. It is used in probability theory, Markov chains, pathfinding algorithms, and AI simulations. It also plays a role in chaos theory and fractal generation, helping study complex systems and unpredictable behaviors.
